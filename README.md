# Counter Time Application

This Flutter application is a simple countdown timer that allows users to set the timer's duration using both minutes and seconds.

The app is designed to help users keep track of time efficiently and can be easily adapted for different uses.

## Features

- Play/Pause functionality: Users can pause and resume the countdown.

- Custom Input Dialog: The app provides a dialog for setting minutes and seconds separately.

- Progress Animation: Visual representation of the remaining time through a CircularProgressIndicator.

- Responsive UI: The app is optimized for different screen sizes and orientations.
